        <h2>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Local Storage</h4>
        <p>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via
            javascript or manually.The client can only read local storage.There is no transfer of data to the server.
            There are fewer old browsers that support it.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Session Storage</h4>
        <p>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means
            that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.The
            client can only read local storage.There is no transfer of data to the server.There are fewer old browsers
            that support it.

        <h2>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Global Scope</h4>
        <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global
            scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
            conditional state can access that variable.
        </p>
        <h4>Block Scope</h4>
        <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
            something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
