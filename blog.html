        <h2>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Local Storage</h4>
        <p>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via
            javascript or manually.The client can only read local storage.There is no transfer of data to the server.
            There are fewer old browsers that support it.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Session Storage</h4>
        <p>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This means
            that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.The
            client can only read local storage.There is no transfer of data to the server.There are fewer old browsers
            that support it.

        <h2>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Global Scope</h4>
        <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global
            scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
            conditional state can access that variable.
        </p>
        <h4>Block Scope</h4>
        <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
            something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

        <h2>How JavaScript works Event loop</h2>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.At some point during the event
            loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one. To do so, the
            message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input
            parameter. As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.
            The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty. Then, the event loop will process
            the next message in the queue
        </p>
        <p class="p1">Heap</p>
        <p>
            Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of
            memory.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">Queue</p>
        <p>A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an
            associated function that gets called to handle the message.

        <h2>How to check if a JavaScript object property is undefined</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an object property is undefined is to use the `typeof`
            operator.The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's
            primitive types.A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement
            also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function
            returns undefined if a value was not returned.
            <br>
            1) Strict equality and undefined. <br>
            2) typeof operator and undefined. <br>
            3) void operator and undefined. <br>
